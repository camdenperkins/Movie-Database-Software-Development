This was the final project for my Software Development class. <br> <br>

# Overview
I created a comprehensive movie database application employing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern with JUnit testing. This approach ensured a clean and organized codebase, eliminating duplication and promoting modularity. The code is  commented, facilitating ease of understanding and future maintenance. The final product is a great example of what I learned from a challenging Fall 2024 semester course and showcases my ability to program at a high level.
