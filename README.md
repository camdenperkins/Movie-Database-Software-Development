This was the final project for my Software Development class. <br> <br>

# Overview
I created a comprehensive movie database application employing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern with JUnit testing. This approach ensured a clean and organized codebase, eliminating duplication and promoting modularity. The code is  commented, facilitating ease of understanding and future maintenance. The application's features allow users to filter movies based on their ratings and cast. The final product is a great example of what I learned from a challenging Fall 2024 semester course and showcases my ability to program at a high level.
